         <h1>Kyle Ortiz - Aspiring Software Developer</h1>
         <p class="intro">As for many others, 2020 was a year filled with infinite challenges and obstacles for me. I lost myself to the burdens of life and couldn't find a way forward for many months, that's when I discovered Flatiron's bootcamp programs! I quickly realized that this was the best use of my money and time instead of finishing the last one and a half years of my degree. After making the field switch toward software engineering, I have felt a greater sense of purpose and drive.</p>

         <p id="hiddenStory">At the age of 21, I made the hard decision to leave behind my music degree for a software engineering bootcamp. This was no easy decision, and its one that took arguably years to make. 
            My higher education journey started in fall of 2017 at the University of Houston. During this semester, being surprised I even made it into college, I had not made a decision for a field of study. 
            After long thought about what I am good at, what I might enjoy, and what might be possible for someone like me; I chose to pursue Music Education. I had been a saxophone player since the age of 9, and grew quite fond of the musical process during my last couple of years in highschool. 
            I figured that given my strong musical passion and background, along with my poor grades as a younger student, I would be better suited to pursue the arts. Before making this decision, I was on the fence between Music and Computer Engineering. 
            All my life I had also be a big tech enthusiast, always wanting to learn more and become proficient at solving the world's problems. I couldn't allow myself to choose this, however, because of my lack of confidence I could keep up with the school work. 
            Deciding on Music and having a great first semester the following Spring, I really found what I loved about Music. Performing. After just a few months of study, I switched from Music Education to Music Performance Major to further commit myself to the craft of classical saxophone playing.
            I knew this wouldn't be easy or finacially rewarding but I wanted to give it my best shot. Through this time studying music, I learned more about myself anf also the real world obstacles I was facing as a musician (especially a classical saxophone player!). 
            I still loved the craft but the pressure to be the best was weighing on me so heavily. Jump to summer of 2019, I was determined to get back in the saddle. I really refined my practice schedule, I was taking care of myself, I was working full-time, and I felt great. 
            My love for this journey was coming back and everything seemed to be going right. Come late August, my family got two hits of bad news. For one, our home was determined no longer livable as toxic mold was discovered inside our walls and in the air. 
            They told us most of our belongings were not treatable and had to be thrown out. My family moved in with my grandparents and as far as we knew, we basically lost everything we owned. A few weeks later, my mother was diagnosed with cirrhosis. 
            I had been shattered. My hardwork began to fade, my ability to get out of bed and go to school was gone. Many months went by for our family and not much got better. I didn't know how to go on with the stress of school and now my family's issues. These things, along with other issues going on, led me to start thinking more practically. 
            "I need to work, I can't (and really no longer wanted to) be a career musician." Over the course of the next year and a half I spent many hours trying to figure out the best way forward. I didn't know if I should just continue and pursue something else after school, leave school, or change majors to restart. 
            Then, one day I discovered coding bootcamps. I did a ton of research and realized that these things could be promising if I put the work in. With my college fund decreasing fast and another year and a half to go on my degree(I had to take a semester off due to family things), I figured it was my best hope for getting into the working field AND still doing something I might enjoy. 
            I applied to two different camps and interviewed at both of them. After some careful thought, I decided on Flatiron! Now, here I am. I am here to learn, grow and become a contributing person in the tech industry. As you can see from this site's quality, I have a long way to go, but I will get there. I know it. </p>
